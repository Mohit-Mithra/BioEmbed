The results for this Machine learning setup are reported using 5-fold cross validation. This folder contains a seperate file for each fold.
The entire dataset is already divided into 5 bins considering only the hormones having atleast 5 genes. One set of bins is for postive (associated) genes and the other for negative (non-associated or random) genes. Make sure the folder structure for reading the input and writing the output is correct depending on the path from which you execute the script.

- Run the BioEmbedS.py file to run the experiments. Make sure to input the test_bin number among [0,1,2,3 or 4] to run the required fold. 

If there are problems in loading the fasttext model file, please use the all_word_embeddings.json file in the dataset folder (it has the embeddings for the required tokens extracted from the model).

The models obtained on each of the 5 folds are saved in the models folder.
The oversampled datasets used to train the model to get results on the test set are also stored in the dataset folder.
The output generated by each fold is stored in an fold_number.out file in the output folder. It also saves the predictions made on the test set for each fold and the average scores obtained for every parameter combination on the validation sets (model_scores files).

- generate_roc_pr_curves.ipynb is used to get the combined ROC and PR curves across the 5 folds.

- get_results_from_simplest_model.py is a script that applies the simplest model obtained out of the 5 folds to all the remaining folds and checks the performance.
