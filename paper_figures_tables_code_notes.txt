----Figures
Fig. 1 -> Overview figure, so code not relevant (also, inset is simple histogram view of HGv1 database in HGv1_Gene.json file, so code not provided). 
Fig. 2 - 2a hierarchical clustering done using Morpheus tool (https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus/) applied on fasttext_word_embeddings.json file, and 2b network visualization generated using Cytoscape tool (https://cytoscape.org/); so code not relevant.
